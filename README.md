# Breaking Changes
I have re-written most of the plugin so in case you need to stay in an old version use the tagged version `v2.2.1` and not master.

# Laravel.nvim
Plugin for Neovim to enhance the development experience of Laravel projects

Quick executing of artisan commands, list and navigate to routes. Information about the routes.
Robust API to allow you to run any command in the way that you need.

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://adalessa.github.io/laravel-nvim-docs/)

# Self promotion
I am Ariel I am a developer and also content creator (mostly in Spanish) if you would like to show some love leave a start into the plugin and subscribe to my [Youtube](https://youtube.com/@Alpha_Dev) if you want to show even more love you can support becoming a member on Youtube. But just leaving a like or letting me know that you like and enjoy the plugin is appreciated.

# Collaboration
I am open to review pr if you have ideas or ways to improve the plugin would be great.
